;;; A chat example that uses pubsub
;;; based off of libp2p-chat.ss by @vyzo
;;;
;;;~~~~~EXAMPLE USAGE~~~~~
;;;
;;;To begin, start a bootstrap node in a seperate terminal by running
;;;./pub-sub-chat.ss bootstrap /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/10333/
;;;
;;;After waiting a few seconds for the libp2p daemon to start up, you should get a list of multiaddresses to use to contact this node
;;;```
;;;starting up
;;;I am /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10333/p2p/<PeerID-A>
;;;I am /ip4/192.168.0.7/tcp/10333/p2p/<PeerID-A>
;;;```
;;;
;;;Next, you need to start up other pubsub nodes to connect to this bootstrap node. In another terminal run
;;;
;;;./pub-sub-chat.ss connect <BootstrapNodeAddress> /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/10332/
;;;
;;;Where <BootstrapNodeAddress> is one of the addresses outputted when you started the Bootstrap node
;;;
;;;This should start up and connect to the bootstrap node. Type in the prompt to start chatting!
;;;
;;;If you would like, feel free to create more pubsub nodes to connect to this bootstrap node. In another terminal run
;;;./pub-sub-chat.ss connect <BootstrapNodeAddress> /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/<ADifferentPort>/
;;;
;;;Where <ADifferentPort> is a port unused by any other pubsub node
;;;
;;;
;;;To exit, Ctrl-C in each terminal window.
